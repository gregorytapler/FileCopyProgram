# FileCopyProgram
Copies the target directories and files to the designated location and saves the copy template for future use.

I initially created this program working on migration projects when a customer would send source files on physical 
disk in stages (Alpha, Beta, etc).

Saving the copy template helped save time later setting up the copy environment.
